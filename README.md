The back end componenent the WTWR Project. This project contains the necessary framework to send and receive requests from a server to fulfill the purposes of the site, which include creating new Clothing Item Cards, creating new Users, storing the associated Items and Likes of Users, etc. The following commands can be used to test the code.

This project was constructed using Express.js, a flexible Node.js application specifically designed to handle back end applications and requests. The Postman and MondoDB Compass applications were also used to test the various functions of the software. Several other minor softwares such as EsLint and Prettier were also used to ensure that the code was consice and consistent.

The project itself follows a basic and streamlined approach typical of Express.js applications. The various controllers, routes, and models were created seperately and integrated through an index file to maintain consise and readable code.
